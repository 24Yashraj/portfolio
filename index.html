									<h2><a href="#">Bank Loan Analysis Using Power-bi and MSSQl<br /></a></h2>
									<p> Developed a comprehensive bank loan dashboard in Power BI, integrating in-depth analysis conducted using MSSQL. The dashboard aimed to present essential KPIs, such as total loan applications, total funded amounts, average interest rates, and average debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. These metrics were analyzed both month-to-date and on a month-on-month basis to track and visualize performance trends effectively.</p>
										<p>The dynamic dashboard included visualizations that compared good versus bad loans, loan status breakdowns, and provided slicers for state-wise and grade-wise analysis. This detailed analysis revealed significant trends, such as an 11.8% higher bad loan rate among small businesses compared to the average, and over 50% higher bad loans for debt consolidation purposes. These insights helped identify high-risk areas and informed better loan management strategies</p>
										<p>The project empowered stakeholders by providing actionable insights that facilitated data-driven decision-making in loan management. The dashboard highlighted critical trends, enabling the development of targeted risk mitigation strategies and improved overall loan portfolio performance. This project demonstrated the value of integrating advanced data analytics with powerful visualization tools to enhance business intelligence and strategic planning.

										<h2><a href="#">Electric Vehicle Analysis<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Hybrid vs_ Electric_ The Pros and Cons of Eco-Friendly Cars.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Developed a Power BI project centered on electric vehicle analytics to analyze sales trends over the past decade. The focus was on Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicles (CAFV) and the percentage distribution of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). Excel was utilized for initial data cleaning and preparation, ensuring a solid foundation for analysis.</p>
										
										<p>The project provided comprehensive insights into the electric vehicle market by examining total vehicles by model year and segmenting company-wise model production annually. Key findings included Tesla's leadership in electric vehicle production, with a 430.77% increase each year. Additionally, it highlighted a significant growth of over 40% in electric car production since 2018 and a strong consumer preference for BEVs, which lead the market with a 77% share compared to PHEVs.</p>  
									<p>	By integrating Excel for data cleaning and Power BI for in-depth analysis and visualization, the project delivered actionable insights into electric vehicle trends. These insights can guide stakeholders in understanding market dynamics, consumer preferences, and production trends, enabling informed strategic planning in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle industry.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Amazon Sales Analysis Using POWER-BI<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Best Deals This Week.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Refined a raw Kaggle dataset by meticulously rectifying null values and transitioning it into a clean, organized format using Excel. The objective was to create a structured dataset that could be effectively used for advanced analysis and visualization in Power BI.</p>
										
										
										<p>Integrated the cleaned dataset into Power BI and employed advanced data modeling techniques to conduct insightful analysis. Visualizations such as filled maps, pie charts, and donut charts were utilized alongside DAX formulas to analyze sales trends. This comprehensive analysis focused on return orders over a span of 4 years, successfully identifying the bottom 5 products in terms of performance.</p>
										
										<p>The project provided deep insights into sales and return order trends, helping stakeholders understand product performance at a granular level. By identifying the bottom five products, it enabled the formulation of targeted strategies to address issues related to product returns. The effective use of Power BI's advanced visualization capabilities demonstrated the power of integrating thorough data cleaning and modeling processes to drive business intelligence and strategic decision-making.</p>
